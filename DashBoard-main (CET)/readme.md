Supply Chain Carbon Emission Tracker Dashboard
Overview
The Supply Chain Carbon Emission Tracker is a dashboard that helps businesses monitor, analyze, and reduce their carbon emissions across the supply chain. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like AI/ML and blockchain, this project provides real-time insights into carbon footprints, predicts future emissions, and ensures transparency and traceability of emission data throughout the logistics network.

Features
Real-time Carbon Emission Monitoring: Track carbon emissions from various supply chain activities (e.g., transportation, warehousing, manufacturing) in real time.

AI/ML Predictions: The dashboard integrates machine learning models to predict future emissions based on historical data, operational activities, and supply chain patterns.

Energy Efficiency Recommendations: Receive data-driven insights to optimize operations, reduce energy consumption, and minimize emissions.

Blockchain for Data Integrity: Ensure transparent and immutable tracking of carbon emissions through blockchain technology, providing verifiable records for all stakeholders.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface with data visualizations, charts, and tables to help users understand emission trends and make informed decisions.
